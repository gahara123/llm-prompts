Please strictly follow the following steps to process each comment entered:
Step 1 - Subsystem Classification
Use the strictly defined 5-subsystem framework (Control Subsystem / Perspective Subsystem / Challenge Subsystem / Core Elements / Key Changes) for sentence-level classification. Use the strictly defined 5-subsystem framework (Control Subsystem / Perspective Subsystem / Challenge Subsystem / Core Elements / Key Changes) for sentence-level classification.
Add the category "Does Not Belong to the Existing Five Classifications" to temporarily store sentences that cannot be matched. Add the category "Does Not Belong to the Existing Five Classifications" to temporarily store sentences that cannot be matched.
Classification Criteria:
a. Control Subsystem: Involves interaction layer designs such as character movement / operation response / button logic, etc.
It involves the hardware input devices used for operations in the game, the input actions on the input devices, what game elements in the game the player directly controls when performing an operation, what direct changes the game elements will undergo during the operation, and how the control feels, etc.;
b. Perspective Subsystem: Descriptions related to camera movement / perspective switching / field of view range.
It involves whether the perspective in the game is fixed or controlled by the program to change and switch, or whether it is manually controlled by the player to change and switch, as well as what the rules of the perspective change are, whether the field of view range of the perspective is reasonable, whether the control of the perspective change is reasonable, and whether the perspective makes the player feel comfortable or uncomfortable, etc.;
c. Challenge Subsystem: Clearly mentions challenge designs such as jumping difficulty, combat mechanism, puzzle-solving logic, etc.
It involves the specific forms of challenges in the game, the main elements involved, the ways and methods to solve the challenges, what main abilities are required to solve the challenges, whether the design of the challenges is reasonable, the rhythm of the appearance of the challenges, the difficulty of the challenges, etc.;
d. Core Elements: Key items / abilities / character attributes that directly affect the gameplay loop.
Elements that are very important or crucial for the advancement of the game, which involve how players solve challenges, or for the player experience, or include what the elements are, what important attributes they have, what functions they can perform, and how players interact with these elements in the game, etc.
e. Key Changes: Disruptive mechanism innovation or dimension transformation design.
It involves some unique change mechanisms in the game, which can be changes brought about by player operations or changes controlled autonomously by the program, including the specific forms of the changes, and what impact these changes have on the gaming experience, etc.
Step 2 - Discovery of New Subsystems
Conduct a secondary analysis of the content of "Does Not Belong to the Existing Five Classifications": If the content of "Does Not Belong to the Existing Five Classifications" contains game rules or important game elements directly related to the player's actions and operations in the game, and they do not belong to the five game subsystems listed above, then please, in combination with your understanding of the game system, classify them into a new game subsystem and generate candidate subsystem suggestions. Conduct a secondary analysis of the content of "Does Not Belong to the Existing Five Classifications": If the content of "Does Not Belong to the Existing Five Classifications" contains game rules or important game elements directly related to the player's actions and operations in the game, and they do not belong to the five game subsystems listed above, then please, in combination with your understanding of the game system, classify them into a new game subsystem and generate candidate subsystem suggestions.
Generate candidate subsystem suggestions (Format: Suggested Name - Feature Description)
For each format, the output format requirements are as follows:
{
    "Original Comment": "Original Text",
    "Analysis Results": [
        {
            "Sentence": "Specific Sentence",
            "Subsystem Classification": ["Control Subsystem", "Core Elements"],
            "Confidence Level": 0.85,
            "Whether It Can Be Classified into a New Subsystem": No,
            "New Subsystem Suggestion": {"Suggested Name": "None", "Feature": "None"}
        }
    ]
}
Notes:
When a sentence involves multiple subsystems, arrange them in descending order of relevance.
The confidence level uses a value in the range of 0-1 to reflect the certainty of classification.
Give priority to using the existing classification framework. Only when the content clearly breaks through the framework should a new subsystem be suggested. When it cannot be classified into a new subsystem, the line of "New Subsystem Suggestion" can be omitted.
Exclude statements that are not related to game design (such as purchase experience, hardware issues)
