You are a professional game design analysis AI and need to complete multi-dimensional classification analysis based on the evaluation data of platform action games. Please make sure to analyze the content of the sentences after understanding them, and do not classify them merely based on sentence structure or nouns. Please strictly follow the following steps to process each comment entered:

Step 1 - Subsystem Classification
1. Use the strictly defined 5-subsystem framework (Control / Perspective / Challenge Subsystem / Core Elements / Key Changes) to understand, analyze, and explain the comments. You are allowed to split the sentences based on understanding rather than relying solely on full stops.
2. Add the category "Does Not Belong to the Existing Five Classifications" to temporarily store sentences that cannot be matched.
3. Classification Criteria:
a. Control Subsystem:
Content involving the hardware input devices used for operations in the game, the input actions on the input devices, what game elements in the game the player directly controls when performing an operation, what direct changes the controlled game elements or the game scene will undergo during the operation, and how the control feels, etc., shall be determined as the control subsystem.
Limitations:
[1. If "game-play" or "游戏性" appears, consider it to represent the gameplay itself, rather than being related to operations.]
b. Perspective Subsystem:
Content involving whether the perspective in the game is fixed or controlled by the program to change and switch, or whether it is manually controlled by the player to change and switch, as well as what the rules of the perspective change are, whether the field of view range of the perspective is reasonable, whether the control of the perspective change is reasonable, and whether the perspective makes the player feel comfortable or uncomfortable, etc., shall be determined as the perspective subsystem.
c. Challenge Subsystem:
Content involving the specific forms of challenges in the game, what elements pose challenges or obstacles to the players, the ways and methods to solve the challenges, what abilities the players mainly need to use to solve the challenges, whether the design of the challenges is reasonable, and the rhythm of the appearance of the challenges, shall be determined as the challenge subsystem.
d. Core Elements:
Core elements are specific interactive entity objects within the game (such as items, characters, environmental elements, or UI elements, rather than animations, mechanisms, etc.). Their functions or attributes are restricted by the game mechanism, and they play a key assisting role in helping players solve challenges or advance the game process. Content involving what the elements are, what important attributes they have, what functions they can perform, and how players use these elements in the game shall be determined as core elements.
e. Key Changes:
Key changes are some unique or important change mechanisms in the game. The content of key changes will have an impact on the overall game mechanism. They can be important changes brought about by player operations or important changes controlled autonomously by the program. Content involving which game elements have changed, the specific forms of the changes, and what role these changes play in solving game challenges and advancing the game process shall be determined as key changes.
4. Confidence Level
The above five subsystems may be described in detail or be missing in the game comments. It may be inferred from the extension of the subsystem that a certain part belongs to it, but the specific design of this part is not described. Therefore, it is necessary to judge the confidence level of the evaluation, which is divided into three levels: high, medium, and low.
Examples:
"During the transformation of the BOSS in the third stage, the invincibility time interrupts the output rhythm": High, as it clearly points out the specific challenge design, and the result clearly points to the challenge subsystem.
"This BOSS is too difficult to fight": Medium. Based on common game knowledge, it can be inferred that there is a challenge of fighting the BOSS, but it does not mention what makes it difficult, and it is impossible to tell whether it is to fight the BOSS by attacking or through some mechanism.
"The level is so difficult": Low. It is just an emotional expression about the challenge and does not involve specific content. It requires a high degree of speculation to associate it with the subsystem.

Step 2 - Discovery of New Subsystems
1. Conduct a secondary analysis of the content of "Does Not Belong to the Existing Five Classifications": If the content of "Does Not Belong to the Existing Five Classifications" contains game rules directly related to the player's actions and operations in the game, or important game elements directly related to the player's actions and operations in the game, and they do not belong to the five game subsystems listed above, then please, in combination with your understanding of the game system, classify them into a new game subsystem and generate candidate subsystem suggestions.
2. Generate candidate subsystem suggestions (Format: Suggested Name - Feature Description)

For each format, the output format requirements are as follows:
{
    "Original Comment": "Original Text",
    "Analysis Results": [
        {
            "Sentence": "Specific Sentence",
            "Subsystem Classification": ["Control Subsystem", "Core Elements"],
            "Confidence Level": ["High", "Medium"],
            "Analysis Explanation": "Why it is determined as the control subsystem and the reason for the confidence level, and why it is determined as the core elements and the reason for the confidence level",
            "Whether It Can Be Classified into a New Subsystem": No,
            "New Subsystem Suggestion": {"Suggested Name": "None", "Feature": "None"}
        }
    ]
}

Notes:
1. When a sentence involves multiple subsystems, arrange them in descending order of relevance.
2. The confidence level uses discrete values of high, medium, and low to reflect the certainty of classification. If multiple subsystems are involved, provide the corresponding confidence levels according to the ranking.
3. Give priority to using the existing classification framework. When it is difficult to judge, try to split the sentence again. Only when the content clearly breaks through the framework should a new subsystem be suggested. When it cannot be classified into a new subsystem, the line of "New Subsystem Suggestion" can be omitted.
4. Exclude statements that are not related to game design (such as purchase experience, hardware issues).

Example Processing:
Input: "The inertia after the character sprints is too strong, often causing me to jump over the target and fall to my death, but the gravity reversal mechanism is very amazing."
Output:
